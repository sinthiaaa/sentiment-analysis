### Attribute Information
This study explores public sentiment towards major ride-sharing applications—Grab, Uber, InDrive, Pathao, Jatri, and Obhai—based on 12,052 user reviews (categorized as Positive, Negative, or Neutral) collected from the Google Play Store. The analysis provides critical insights into customer satisfaction and service quality across platforms.

### Methodology
The process involved data collection, annotation, preprocessing, model implementation, and performance evaluation. Both deep learning (LSTM, GRU, BiLSTM, BiGRU) and machine learning (SVM, Random Forest, Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, etc.) models were applied to classify sentiments from the user reviews.

### Results
Performance outcomes of selected models:

Deep Learning

BiGRU: 94.97% (Highest Accuracy)

Other deep models like LSTM, GRU, and BiLSTM also performed well.

Machine Learning

Support Vector Machine (SVM): 76.70% (Best among ML models)

Other algorithms (RF, DT, KNN, Naive Bayes, etc.) yielded lower performance.

### Conclusion
The findings demonstrate that deep learning models, particularly Bidirectional GRU, significantly outperform traditional machine learning approaches in sentiment classification tasks. This highlights the growing potential of deep learning in understanding user feedback, aiding ride-sharing companies in improving user experience and service reliability.
